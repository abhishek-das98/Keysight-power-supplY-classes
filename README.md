# Keysight-power-supplY-classes

This MATLAB class is written to control two KEYSIGHT DC power supplies: _E36103B_ and _E36312A_. Although, the two power supply has different number of input ports, the class is written accordingly to handle that issue. This class utilize the _SCPI Programming Language_. For detailed guideline on the instruments and SCPI language, please search the KEYSIGHT power supply programming manual on web, which should be readily available. 

Once you download the class, the rudimentary wroks like setting the voltage, reading voltage, setting the currents, etc. become really easy to handle, specially when you want to visualize data.
